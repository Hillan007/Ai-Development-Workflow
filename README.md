 Predicting 30-Day Patient Readmission Risk using AI
This project explores the use of machine learning to predict whether a patient is at risk of being readmitted within 30 days after discharge. Itâ€™s designed to support healthcare providers with timely interventions that can improve outcomes and reduce costs.

Problem Statement
Hospitals often face financial penalties and strained resources due to high readmission rates. Accurately predicting which patients are likely to return within 30 days of discharge allows for proactive follow-up and resource allocation.
Objectives:
- Identify patients at high risk of readmission
- Enable targeted post-discharge care planning
- Improve clinical outcomes and reduce operational costs

Stakeholders
- Hospital administrators and clinicians
- Patients and care coordinators
- Data science and IT teams

Dataset & Features
Data Sources:
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Discharge summaries
- Patient demographics and comorbidities
Key Features:
- Age, gender, diagnosis codes
- Number of prior admissions
- Length of hospital stay
- Discharge type and medications prescribed

Preprocessing Pipeline
- Handle missing values with imputation
- Normalize lab results and numerical features
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., discharge type)
- Engineer features like chronic_condition_flag and time_since_last_admission

Model
We use XGBoost (Gradient Boosting) for its robustness and performance on tabular healthcare data.
Training & Evaluation:
- 70/15/15 split (train/validation/test)
- Precision and recall used due to class imbalance
- Feature importance and SHAP values for interpretability
Hypothetical Confusion Matrix:
|  | Predicted: Readmit | Predicted: Not Readmit | 
| Actual: Readmit | 80 | 20 | 
| Actual: Not Readmit | 30 | 170 | 



 Evaluation Metrics
- Precision: 0.727
- Recall: 0.80
These metrics prioritize minimizing false negatives while reducing alert fatigue.

Deployment
Model deployed via FastAPI for real-time API access. Connected to hospital EHR systems for on-discharge risk scoring. Dashboard integration allows clinicians to view predictions and take action.
HIPAA Compliance Steps:
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Access control and audit logs
- Secure cloud deployment on HIPAA-compliant services

Ethical Considerations
- Addressing data bias through subgroup validation
- Regular model audits to ensure fair predictions
- Patient privacy maintained through data anonymization

Optimization
To avoid overfitting, we implement:
- Early stopping
- Cross-validation
- Regular retraining with updated data

ðŸ§­ Reflection
The most challenging part was preprocessing sensitive and messy healthcare data while ensuring compliance. With more time, we would include domain experts in the loop and use more advanced AutoML pipelines for feature extraction.
